# AirBnB Clone v2

This project is an extension of the AirBnB Clone project, now with added functionalities, unit tests, and a MySQL backend. The goal is to implement an AirBnB-like platform where users can create, manage, and book accommodations.

## Introduction

The AirBnB Clone v2 project is a collaborative effort between two team members, Hussein and Garane, along with contributions from other individuals listed below. It is built using Python, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, unit testing, and database management.

# Project Structure

The project is organized into several components:

- Python Scripts: Python scripts form the core of the project, implementing the backend logic, command-line interface, and database interactions.
  
- SQL Scripts: SQL scripts are used to set up the MySQL databases for development and testing purposes.

- Unit Tests: Unit tests are implemented using the `unittest` module to ensure the correctness of the codebase.

- README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and other relevant details.

# Requirements

- Python Scripts: All Python scripts should be compatible with Python 3.8.5 and must follow certain guidelines regarding documentation, code style, and execution permissions.

- Unit Tests: Unit tests must cover all functionalities of the project, ensuring that they pass without errors at any time. Additionally, the PEP8 code style should be adhered to.

- SQL Scripts: SQL scripts should be compatible with MySQL 8.0 and SQLAlchemy 1.4.x. They should follow specific conventions regarding file structure, syntax, and comments.

- GitHub: Each team must have a dedicated GitHub repository for the project. The repository should be well-structured and contain all necessary files and documentation.

# Project Tasks

The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of development. These tasks include setting up the project environment, implementing unit tests, improving the command-line interface, configuring the MySQL database, and integrating SQLAlchemy for database management.

# Learning Objectives

Throughout the project, team members are expected to gain knowledge and skills in various areas, including:

- Unit testing implementation in a large project.
- Understanding and using `*args` and `**kwargs`.
- Handling named arguments in functions effectively.
- Creating and managing a MySQL database.
- Using SQLAlchemy to map Python classes to MySQL tables.
- Handling two different storage engines with the same codebase.
- Utilizing environment variables for configuration management.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/AirBnB_clone_v2).
2. Set up the MySQL databases for development and testing using the provided SQL scripts.
3. Install any necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Execute the unit tests using `python3 -m unittest discover tests` to ensure everything is working correctly.
5. Start exploring and extending the project as needed.

## Conclusion

The AirBnB Clone v2 project offers a hands-on learning experience in developing a complex software system using Python, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy. By collaborating with a teammate and following best practices in software development, team members can gain valuable insights and skills that are highly applicable in the industry.
